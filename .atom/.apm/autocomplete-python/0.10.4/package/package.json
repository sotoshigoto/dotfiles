Or launch Atom from the [activated virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide.html#activate-script) to get completion for your third-party packages\n* If you're on Windows:\n  * Install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)\n  * Make Sure that python is available in your PATH: `echo %PATH%`. If it's not, add it and restart your system: `set PATH=%PATH%;C:\\Python27`\n* Be sure to check package settings and adjust them. Please read them carefully before creating any new issues\n  * Set path to python directory if package cannot find your python executable\n  * Set extra path if package cannot autocomplete external python libraries\n  * Select one of autocomplete function parameters if you want function arguments to be completed\n\n  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/193864/10657279/540d39f4-78bb-11e5-9bbf-283fb67c9fd4.png)\n\n\n# Common problems\n\n* \"Error: spawn UNKNOWN\" on Windows\n  * Solution: Find your python executable and uncheck the \"Run this program as an administrator\".
